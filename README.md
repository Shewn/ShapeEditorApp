# Shape Editing App

Welcome to the **Shape Editing App**! This is a simple canvas-based application where users can draw shapes, upload images, and interact with a variety of tools. The app uses React, TypeScript, and MobX for state management.

## Features:

- Draw shapes (rectangle, circle, and freeform brush).
- Fill the canvas with a color.
- Upload and place images on the canvas.
- Undo and clear canvas actions.
- Layers panel to manage shapes.
- Select or unselect tools, with "no action" when no tool is selected.

## Prerequisites:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

## Steps to Run the App:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Development Server

Once dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the app on your local development server, usually at http://localhost:3000.

### 3. Open the App in Your Browser

Once the development server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

You should now see the app running, ready for you to start drawing and editing on the canvas!
